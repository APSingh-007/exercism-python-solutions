# Exercism Python Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from the  **Python track** on **Exercism**. Each folder represents a different exercise with its corresponding solution.

## 📁 **Repository Structure**

```
exercism-python-solutions/
│-- exercise-1/
│   ├── solution.py
│   ├── test_solution.py
│-- exercise-2/
│   ├── solution.py
│   ├── test_solution.py
│-- ...
│-- .gitignore
│-- README.md
```

- Each **exercise folder** contains:
    
    - `solution.py` → My implementation of the exercise.
        
    - `test_solution.py` → Test cases for the solution.
